# Phone-book

This is my first programming project, is a common phonebook created using predominantly python with an SQL database integrated. 

For the Web development, I use Flask, CSS, and HTML which helped me to create the website on my local machine.

The main actions you can do on the Phone book are to add a new contact, delete an existing one and extract a list of all the contacts inside the phonebook depending on the research key you chose.
